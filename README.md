# sudoko_solution-from-images-Computer-Vision

The project is divided into three parts

Part One: Digit Classification Model Build and train a neural network on the Chars74K image dataset for digits. This will be further used in classifying the digits in the image.

Part Two: Detecting And Reading The Sudoku From An ImageIdentify the sudoku puzzle in an image using OpenCV-library. Classify the digits in the detected sudoku puzzle using the model made in part one. Getting the values of the cells in the sudoku in for of array.

Part Three: Solving The Puzzle the array is converted into matrix. The given puzzle is are solved using recursion.
